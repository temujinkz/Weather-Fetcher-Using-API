# 1. Set Up the Project
You'll need an API key from a weather service provider (such as OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI, etc.). For this example, I'll use OpenWeatherMap. Create an account at OpenWeatherMap and get your API key.

# 2. Install Required Libraries
Ensure you have requests installed in your environment. You can install it using: pip install requests

# 3. How it Works
This script uses the OpenWeatherMap API to get weather data for a given city.
The user is prompted to input a city name, and the API call is made.
The response is processed, and relevant data like temperature, humidity, weather condition, and wind speed is printed.
