1. Set Up the Project
You'll need an API key from a weather service provider (such as OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI, etc.). For this example, I'll use OpenWeatherMap. Create an account at OpenWeatherMap and get your API key.

2. Install Required Libraries
Ensure you have requests installed in your environment. You can install it using: pip install requests
